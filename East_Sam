After leaving the confines of the tribe walls, you come to face the rising sun upon turning East.
The grassy plains reach the horizon, with distant mountains set against a sunny blue canvas. This endless landscape give you encouragement for your search for the buffalo.
As the wind rushes through the tall grass, you hear the whispers of your ancestors, and feel the power of the hunt.
Both you and your companions march on until you come across a stream. The water is steady and runs down the hillside. The chance of a watering hole is increased by this sight of flowing water, but which way do you go?  
  
UPSTREAM  
Your direction takes you upstream as the water begins to become more rapid and splashes at your feet. The rocks are uneven but you march alongside the water.  
  
DOWNSTREAM  
Heading down the hillside, and along the flowing stream, your group continue on in the search for the buffalo. The stream leads into a watering hole, however there are no buffalo to be seen.
